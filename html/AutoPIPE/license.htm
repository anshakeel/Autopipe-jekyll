<h1>How to Activate AutoPIPE&reg;&nbsp;</h1>

<p><hr><p>
Subscription Entitlement Service is Bentley's new licensing model, providing enhanced security and optimized value for your Bentley Subscriptions. It is integrated with Bentley's Identity Management System (IMS) and the Bentley CONNECT technology platform to allow near real-time reporting of usage, improved alert messaging to users and increased administrative capabilities to license administrators in your organization. It will not only give you more options to monitor and manage usage but also provide new, advanced licensing features that will enhance digital workflows. 

<h2>Activation</h2>
<p>With Subscription Entitlement Service, all users must be registered with Bentley's Identity Management System (IMS) and sign in to the CONNECTION Client to access Bentley applications. Product activation will now occur through user sign-in to the CONNECTION Client with a valid IMS ID associated with their account. User sign-in will replace traditional activation keys, offering enhanced security as administrators will be able to control which users have access to Bentley software. License entitlements are granted and maintained through Subscription Entitlement Service's <a href ="https://communities.bentley.com/products/licensing/w/licensing__wiki/38028/2---entitlement-management-configuration" target="_Online">Entitlement Management Service</a>. By signing into the CONNECTION Client users can also find their organization's projects, download software updates, receive relevant notifications, and track their usage. </p>
   
<h2>Alerts</h2>
<p>Subscription Entitlement Service features the new license alerts notifications that can be set by an organization's license administrators to let the users know when they reach a set usage threshold. These notifications will alert the users that if they continue to use the product, a term license may be issued. The user in such a situation has the choice to quit the application before a license is used or acknowledge that a term license may be generated and proceed with starting the application, based on what settings the administrator chooses. </p>
